Version 1.0 is the prototype pcb actually produced.
However it contains a LOT of bugs, so before making your own one, I recommend reading through the bug list and make a new version, starting from the current state of version 1.1.
Please note the new designed ir-sensor board which fits in connector SV2. The ones attached on the v1.0 and v1.1 boards simply do not work.
The yellow wires in version 1.1 have been added to the PCB of version 1.0 by wireing on the patchfield.
