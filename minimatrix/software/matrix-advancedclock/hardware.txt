Hardware:  Interrupt priority:  Prescaler: Modified on speed boost:  Usage:
RTC clock: compare-high         1          no                        used for display
RTC clock: overflow-low         1          no                        used for clock
timer C0:  overflow-low         1          yes                       used for sound                (needs interrupt as long as sound is active)
timer C1:  --                   256        no                        used for performance counter
timer D0:  overflow-medium      1          yes                       used for dcf77 sampling       (needs interrupt as long as signal is syncronizing)
timer D1:  --                   8          yes                       2MHz rc clock synchronization
timer E0:  overflow-low         1          no                        used for RC-5 decoding        (needs interrupt only if incoming signal is detected)
timer E1:  overflow-low         1          yes                       used for RFM12 decoding       (needs interrupt as long as module is active)
USART E0:  tx-medium                       yes                       used for RS232 print           medium level permits debug print in low level interrupts
timer F0:  --                   1          no                        used for touch keys

Possible timer prescalers: 1, 8, 64, 256, 1024
For analyzing the DCF signal, the CPU speed is boosted from 2MHz to 16MHz,
this requires a change of the running timers to preventing running faster.
Therefore the prescalers are changed from 1 to 8 and from 8 to 64 for timers
where this matters.
