          Interrupt priority:   Usage:
RTC clock: compare-high         Used for display
RTC clock: overflow-low         Used for clock
timer C0:  overflow-low         used for sound                (needs interrupt as long as sound is active)
timer C1:  --                   used for performance counter
timer D0:  overflow-medium      used for dcf77 sampling       (needs interrupt as long as signal is syncronizing)
timer D1:  --                   2MHz rc clock synchronization
timer E0:  overflow-low         used for RC-5 decoding        (needs interrupt only if incoming signal is detected)
timer E1:  overflow-low         used for RFM12 decoding       (needs interrupt as long as module is active)
USART E0:  tx-medium            used for RS232 print           medium level permits debug print in low level interrupts
