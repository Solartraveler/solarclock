RTC clock: Used for display + rtc       (needs compare and overflow interrupts)
timer C0: used for sound                (needs interrupt as long as sound is active)
timer C1: used for performance counter  (no interrupts)
timer D0: used for dcf77 sampling       (needs interrupt as long as signal is syncronizing)
timer D1: 2MHz rc clock synchronization (no interrupts)
timer E0: used for RC-5 decoding        (needs interrupt only if incoming signal is detected)
timer E1: used for RFM12 decoding       (needs interrupt as long as module is active)
